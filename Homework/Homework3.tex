    \begin{enumerate}

      \item We want to find the probability that both units failed. This can be expressed as event $A$ AND event $B$, indicating failure of the processors. Per our formulas, we know:

        $$P[A|B]=\frac{P[A\cap B]}{P[B]}$$

        Per the given information, we know that $P[A|B]=.3$ and $P[B]=.02$. Thus, we may calculate to get:

        $$\boxed{P[A\cap B]=.006}$$

      \item We may calculate the probability of no good units in five systems by simply raising part (a) to the power of 5 to get:

        $$\boxed{P_5[A\cap B]=7.776\cdot10^{-12}}$$

      \item The probability that there is a working unit in a single computer can be given by the complement of no working units. Thus, we see:

        $$P[(A\cap B)^c]=1-.006=.994$$

        We can then sum the possible combinations for the other two computers (at least one working or none working) to get:

        $$P_3[(A\cap B)^c]=.994(.994^2+(.994)(.006)+.006^2)$$
        $$\boxed{P_3[(A\cap B)^c]=.9881}$$

    \end{enumerate}

  \item

    \begin{enumerate}

      \item The probability that the system does not fail may be expressed as:

        $$P[F^c]=(1-p)^{20}$$

        We can thus take the complement and say that failure will occur for:

        $$P[F]=1-(1-p)^{20}$$

        From the problem, the system failure rate is 20\%, which gives us:

        $$1-(1-p)^{20}=.2$$

        From here, we solve:

        $$(1-p)^{20}=.8$$
        $$1-p=\sqrt[20]{.8}$$
        $$p=1-\sqrt[20]{.8}$$
        $$\boxed{p=.011095}$$

      \item Similar to part (a), we now solve for a failure rate of $.1$:

        $$1-(1-p)^{20}=.1$$
        $$(1-p)^{20}=.9$$
        $$p=1-\sqrt[20]{.9}$$
        $$\boxed{p=.0052542}$$

    \end{enumerate}

  \item

    \begin{enumerate}

      \item We can calculate this by multiplying the success rates together:

        $$P_3=(.9)^2(.8)$$
        $$\boxed{P_3=.648}$$

      \item We want to calculate the probability of at least one of the components succeeding. This may be expressed as:

        $$P_{1+}=\underbrace{2[(.9)(.1)(.2)]}_{\text{One router}}+\overbrace{[(.1)^2(.8)]}^{\text{Only switch}}+\underbrace{[(.9)^2(.2)]}_{\text{Both routers}}+\overbrace{2[(.9)(.8)(.1)]}^{\text{One router/one switch}}+.648$$
        $$\boxed{P_{1+}=.998}$$

      \item To find the odds of exactly one of the components passing, we simply subtract cases from above in which multiple devices pass. This gives us:

        $$P_{1}=.998-2[(.9)(.8)(.1)]-[(.9)^2(.2)]-.648$$
        $$\boxed{P_{1}=.044}$$

      \item Since we know the probability that no components fail, we simply take the complement to find the probability that a component does fail:

        $$P_3^c=1-.648$$
        $$\boxed{P_3^c=.352}$$

      \item Per our formulas, we can find $P[\text{all}|\text{one}]$ as:

        $$P[\text{all}|\text{one}]=\frac{.648}{.998}$$
        $$\boxed{P[\text{all}|\text{one}]=.6493}$$

    \end{enumerate}

  \item

    \begin{enumerate}

      \item Given that $n$ can be the range of $[2,5]$, we know that the PMF must contain:

        $$\left\{ \frac{c}{4},\frac{c}{8},\frac{c}{16},\frac{c}{32} \right\}$$

        We know that the probabilities within a PMF must sum to 1, so we get:

        $$\frac{c}{4}+\frac{c}{8}+\frac{c}{16}+\frac{c}{32}=1$$

        We simplify to find:

        $$8c+4c+2c+c=32$$
        $$\boxed{c=\frac{32}{17}}$$

      \item We can take the complement of the probability that two packets are transmitted to find:

        $$P[3+]=1-\frac{1}{4}\left( \frac{32}{17} \right)$$
        $$\boxed{P[3+]=\frac{7}{17}=.4118}$$

      \item We can find the probability of an odd packet to be:

        $$P[3+\cap Odd]=\left( \frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{32} \right)\frac{32}{17}$$
        $$P[3+\cap Odd]=\frac{5}{17}$$

        We then divide by the probability of three or more to find:

        $$\boxed{P[Odd|3+]=\frac{5}{7}=.7143}$$

      \item We can express the probability for a given $n$ as:

        $$P[C]=\sum_{n=2}^5 P_N(n)(.95)^n$$

        This gives us the following values:

        \begin{center}
          \begin{tabular}[H]{|c|c|}
           \hline
           $n$ & $P_n[C]$\\
           \hline
           2 & .4247\\
           \hline
           3 & .2017\\
           \hline
           4 & .095824\\
           \hline
           5 & .045517\\
           \hline
           Total & .7677\\
           \hline
          \end{tabular}
        \end{center}

    \end{enumerate}

  \item

    \begin{enumerate}
        
      \item Based on the given information, we may express the probability of 2 or 3 servers as $c$. This gives us:

        $$\left\{ \frac{c}{4},\frac{c}{2},c,c,\frac{c}{4} \right\}$$

        We know the values need to sum to 1, which gives us:

        $$\frac{2c}{4}+\frac{c}{2}+2c=1$$
        $$\frac{c}{2}+\frac{c}{2}+2c=1$$
        $$3c=1$$
        $$\boxed{c=\frac{1}{3}}$$

        Thus, we get:

        $$\left\{ \frac{1}{12},\frac{1}{6},\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{12} \right\}$$

      \item Based on the PMF above, we sum to get:

        $$P[2+]=1-\frac{1}{12}-\frac{1}{6}$$
        $$\boxed{P[2+]=.75}$$

    \end{enumerate}

  \item We may express the PMF of A as a binomial distribution, since the pulled resistor is either $A$ or not. This gives us $n=10$ and a probability of $p=1/3$, since each resistor is equally likely. This gives us the terms of the PMF as:

    $$\left( \begin{matrix} 10\\n\end{matrix} \right)(1/3)^{p}(2/3)^{p-n}$$

    We iterate to get:

    $$P_n(x)=\left\{.017342, .086708, .19509, .26012, .22761, .13656, .056902,$$$$.016258, .0030483, .00033870, .000016935 \}$$

    From here, we find the probability of 2 or more $A$ resistors as:

    $$P[2+]=1-.017342-.086708$$
    $$\boxed{P[2+]=.896}$$

  \item We begin by finding the probability that a generation-ending pair is combined. We may iterate through possible values of
