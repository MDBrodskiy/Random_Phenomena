  \item 

    \begin{enumerate}

      \item Given the Poisson distribution with given mean of $\alpha=.1$ interruptions per minute gives us a PMF of:

        $$\boxed{P_{\alpha}(n)=\frac{(.1)^ne^{-.1}}{n!}}$$

      \item The expectation value is simply given as the average value, such that:

        $$\boxed{E[X]=.1}$$

        Furthermore, we know that the same value represents the standard deviation. Since we know that the standard deviation is the square root of the variance we get:

        $$\sigma=\sqrt{.1}$$
        $$\boxed{\sigma=.3162}$$

      \item Given a 10 minute period, we may take $\alpha\to 10(.1)\to 1$. This gives us:

        $$P_{10}(n)=\frac{(1)^ne^{-1}}{n!}$$

        We want the probability of no events, so we may take $n\to 0$ to get:

        $$P_{10}(0)=\frac{(1)^0e^{-1}}{0!}$$
        $$\boxed{P_{10}(0)=.3679}$$

      \item Given a 20 minute period, we may take $\alpha\to 20(.1)\to 2$. This gives us:

        $$P_{20}(n)=\frac{(2)^ne^{-2}}{n!}$$

        We want the probability of two or more events, so we may take the complement of 2, 1 or no events. This gives us:

        $$P_{20}(>2)=1-\left(\frac{(2)^0e^{-2}}{0!}+\frac{(2)^1e^{-2}}{1!}+\frac{(2)^2e^{-2}}{2!}\right)$$

  \item First and foremost, we see that this CDF is valid, since the probabilities add up to 100\%, or $1$.

    \begin{enumerate}

      \item We can find the first value as:

        $$P[Y<3] = F[2]$$
        $$\boxed{P[Y<3] =.25}$$

        We can then find:

        $$P[Y\leq 3]=F[3]$$
        $$\boxed{P[Y\leq3] =.5}$$

      \item We can see that:

        $$P[Y< 4]=P[Y\leq 3]=F[3]$$
        $$\boxed{P[Y< 4]=.5}$$

        From here, we may find:

        $$P[Y\geq 4]=1-P[Y<4]$$
        $$\boxed{P[Y\geq 4]=.5}$$

      \item Since there is no ``bump'' up at $y=2$, we may find:

        $$\boxed{P[Y=2]=F[2]-F[1]=0}$$

        Similarly, we may find:

        $$\boxed{P[1\leq Y<3]=F[2]-F[1]=0}$$

      \item We know that the PMF may be expressed as:

        $$PMF(Y)=F[Y]-F[Y-1]$$

        Using this, we construct:

        $$\boxed{PMF(Y)=\left\{ \begin{array}{ll} .25, & y=1\\.25, & y=3\\.5, & y=4\\ 0, & \text{otherwise} \end{array}}$$

    \end{enumerate}

  \item 

    \begin{enumerate}

      \item We may observe that this is a geometric distribution, which means that the expectation may be written as:

        $$E[K]=\frac{1}{p}=\frac{1}{.05}$$
        $$\boxed{E[K]=20}$$

        From here, we may find the variance:

        $$\text{Var}[K]=\frac{1-p}{p^2}=\frac{.95}{.05^2}$$
        $$\boxed{\text{Var}[K]=380}$$

        And finally, we use this to find the standard deviation:

        $$\sigma_K=\sqrt{\text{Var}[K]}=\sqrt{380}$$
        $$\boxed{\sigma_K=19.494}$$

      \item We may write the CDF using a sum and the formula for a geometric distribution:

        $$\boxed{\text{CDF}_K[n]=\sum_{n=1}^{n_K}(.05)(.95)^n}$$

        Where $n$ represents the attempt number and $n_K$ is the number of attempts until an error is encountered.

      \item Let us find the probability of observing the expectation value:

        $$P[K=E[K]]=(.05)(.95)^{20}$$

        This gives us:

        $$\boxed{P[K=20]=.017924}$$

      \item We can find the probability that more attempts than expected are taken as:

        $$P[K>20]=1-\sum_{n=1}^{20}(.05)(.95)^n$$

        This gives us:

        $$\boxed{P[K>20]=.3906}$$

      \item On the other hand, we may find the probability that less attempts than expected are needed:

        $$P[K<20]=1-P[K>20]-P[K=20]$$
        $$P[K<20]=1-.3906-.017924$$
        $$\boxed{P[K<20]=.5915}$$
