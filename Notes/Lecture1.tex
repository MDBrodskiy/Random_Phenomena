  \item What is a Set?

    \begin{itemize}

      \item A set is a collection of objects (elements) that make up the set

      \item We usually use upper case letters to describe a set and lower-case letters to refer to the elements

      \item A set can be defined using enumerations:

        $$A=\left\{ \text{Jane}, \text{Bill},\cdots \right\}$$
        $$B=\left\{ 1,2,3,\cdots \right\}$$

      \item A set can also be defined using a description method

      \item $A=\left\{ x\,|\,x\text{ satisfies some property} \right\}$

      \item For example:

        $$A=\left\{ \text{Students } | \text{ Students who earned an 'A'} \right\}$$

      \item A set can have a finite or infinite number of elements

      \item Useful notations:

        \begin{itemize}

          \item $x\in A \equiv$ element $x$ is contained in $A$

          \item $x\notin A \equiv$ element $x$ is \underline{not} contained in $A$

          \item $C=\left\{  \right\}=\emptyset$ — $C$ is an empty or null set

          \item $D=S$ — Universal set including all elements in a given category

          \item $A\subset B$ — $A$ is a subset of set $B$

          \item Simple Set: A set with a single element
            
          \item Set equality: $A=B$ only if $A\subset B$ and $B\subset A$

          \item $A^C\equiv$ complement of set $A$, which includes all elements in a given category that are not in set $A$

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
