  \item What is a Set?

    \begin{itemize}

      \item A set is a collection of objects (elements) that make up the set

      \item We usually use upper case letters to describe a set and lower-case letters to refer to the elements

      \item A set can be defined using enumerations:

        $$A=\left\{ \text{Jane}, \text{Bill},\cdots \right\}$$
        $$B=\left\{ 1,2,3,\cdots \right\}$$

      \item A set can also be defined using a description method

      \item $A=\left\{ x\,|\,x\text{ satisfies some property} \right\}$

      \item For example:

        $$A=\left\{ \text{Students } | \text{ Students who earned an 'A'} \right\}$$

      \item A set can have a finite or infinite number of elements

      \item Useful notations:

        \begin{itemize}

          \item $x\in A \equiv$ element $x$ is contained in $A$

          \item $x\notin A \equiv$ element $x$ is \underline{not} contained in $A$

          \item $C=\left\{  \right\}=\emptyset$ — $C$ is an empty or null set

          \item $D=S$ — Universal set including all elements in a given category

          \item $A\subset B$ — $A$ is a subset of set $B$

          \item Simple Set: A set with a single element
            
          \item Set equality: $A=B$ only if $A\subset B$ and $B\subset A$

          \item $A^C\equiv$ complement of set $A$, which includes all elements in a given category that are not in set $A$

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item The Inclusion-Exclusion Rule

    \begin{itemize}

      \item For two finite sets $A$ and $B$, we have:

        $$|A\cup B|=|A|+|B|-|A\cap B|$$

      \item This can be expanded to three sets (with a new set $C$):

        $$|A\cup B\cup C|=|A|+|B|+|C|-|A\cap B| - |A\cap C| - |B\cap C| + |A\cap B\cap C|$$

    \end{itemize}

  \item Types of Sets

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Collectively Exhaustive Sets — A collection of sets $A_1,A_2,\cdots,A_n$ are collectively exhaustive if (at least one of the events must occur):

        $$A_1\cup A_2 \cup \cdots \cup A_n=S$$

      \item Mutually Exclusive Sets — Two sets are mutually exclusive if they have no elements in common:

        $$A_i\cap A_f = \emptyset\quad i\neq j$$

      \item Partitions — A collection of sets $A_1,A_2,\cdots,A_n$ is a partition if they are both mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive:

        $$A_1\cup A_2\cup \cdots \cup A_n=S\quad\text{ and }\quad A_i\cap A_j=\emptyset\quad i\neq j$$

    \end{itemize}

  \item Algebraic Rules of Manipulating Sets

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Commutative: $A\cap B= B\cap A$ and $A\cup B = B\cup A$

      \item Associative: $A\cap (B\cap C)= (A\cap B)\cap C$

      \item Distributive: $A\cup (B\cap C)= (A\cup B)\cap (A\cup C)$

      \item De Morgan's Law: $(A\cup B)^c = A^c\cap B^c$ and $(A\cap B)^c=A^c\cup B^c$

    \end{itemize}

  \item Applying Set Theory to Probability Theory

    \begin{itemize}

      \item The Probability Function

        \begin{itemize}

          \item A probability measure $P[x]$ is a function that maps events in the sample space to real numbers

          \item The probability function assigns a value $0$ to $1$ to a certain event; for example, the probability function of rolling a single, standard die would be $P[1]=P[2]=\cdots=P[6]=1/6$

        \end{itemize}

      \item Axioms of Probability

        \begin{itemize}

          \item For any event $A$, $P[A]\geq 0$

          \item $P[S]=1$

          \item For any countable collection of mutually exclusive events:

            $$P[A_1\cup A_2\cup\cdots\cup A_n]=P[A_1]+P[A_2]+\cdots+P[A_n]$$

        \end{itemize}

      \item Consequences of the Axioms

        \begin{itemize}

          \item For mutually exclusive events, $P[A\cup B]=P[A]+P[B]$

          \item For mutually exclusive events, $A_1, A_2, \cdots, A_N$:

            $$P[A_1\cup A_2\cup\cdots\cup A_N]=P[A_1]+P[A_2]+\cdots+P[A_N]$$

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
