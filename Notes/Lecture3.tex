\begin{itemize}

  \item The Law of Total Expectation

    $$E[Y]=E_X[E[Y|X]]$$

  \item The Law of Total Variance

    $$\text{Var}[Y]=E_X[\text{Var}[Y|X]]+\text{Var}_X[E[Y|X]]$$

  \item For joint random variables, we know:

    \begin{itemize}

      \item $F_{XY}(x,y)=\displaystyle \int_{-\infty}^y\int_{-\infty}^x f_{XY}(x,y)\,dx\,dy$

      \item $F_{XY}(\infty,\infty)=1$

      \item $F_{XY}(x,\infty)$ represents the marginal CDF of $X$, $F_X(x)$

      \item $F_{XY}(\infty,y)$ represents the marginal CDF of $Y$, $F_Y(y)$

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
