\begin{itemize}

  \item The Law of Total Expectation

    $$E[Y]=E_X[E[Y|X]]$$

  \item The Law of Total Variance

    $$\text{Var}[Y]=E_X[\text{Var}[Y|X]]+\text{Var}_X[E[Y|X]]$$

  \item For joint random variables, we know:

    \begin{itemize}

      \item $F_{XY}(x,y)=\displaystyle \int_{-\infty}^y\int_{-\infty}^x f_{XY}(x,y)\,dx\,dy$

      \item $F_{XY}(\infty,\infty)=1$

      \item $F_{XY}(x,\infty)$ represents the marginal CDF of $X$, $F_X(x)$

      \item $F_{XY}(\infty,y)$ represents the marginal CDF of $Y$, $F_Y(y)$

    \end{itemize}

  \item Sum of Two Random Variables

    \begin{itemize}

      \item $Z=X+Y$

      \item $E[Z]=E[X]+E[Y]$ ($\mu_Z=\mu_X+\mu_Y$)

      \item $\text{Var}[Z]=\text{Var}[X+Y]=E[((X+Y)-(\mu_X+\mu_Y)^2)]$

      \item $\text{Var}[Z]=E[((X-\mu_X)^2+2(X-\mu_X)(Y-\mu_Y)+(Y-\mu_Y)^2)]$

      \item $\text{Var}[Z]=\text{Var}[X]+\text{Var}[Y]+2E[(X-\mu_X)(Y-\mu_Y)]$

      \item $\text{Var}[Z]=\text{Var}[X]+\text{Var}[Y]+2\text{Cov}(X,Y)$

      \item $\text{Var}[Z]=E[((X-\mu_X)^2+2(X-\mu_X)(Y-\mu_Y)+(Y-\mu_Y)^2)]$

      \item Covariance:

        $$\text{Cov}(X,Y)=E[(X-\mu_X)(Y-\mu_Y)]$$

    \end{itemize}

  \item The Correlation Coefficient

    $$\rho(X,Y)=\frac{\text{Cov}(X,Y)}{\sigma_X\sigma_Y}$$

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Standardizes covariance to range from -1 to 1, making it unitless and easier to interpret

      \item When the correlation coefficient magnitude is close to unity, it implies a high level of correlation

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
