  \item Ergodic Wide Sense Stationary Process

    \begin{itemize}

      \item The time average of each sample function is defined as:

        $$\overline{x(t)}=\lim_{T\to\infty}\frac{1}{T}\int_{-T/2}^{T/2}x(t)\,dt$$

      \item The time autocorrelation function is defined as:

        $$\mathcal{R}_{XX}(\tau)=\overline{x(t)x(t+\tau)}=\lim_{T\to\infty}\frac{1}{T}\int_{-T/2}^{T/2}x(t)x(t+\tau)\,dt$$

      \item For an ergodic wide sense stationary process, the time averages are equal to the corresponding ensemble averages

    \end{itemize}
